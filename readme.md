I will add a readme with actual helpful information after I've got the project further along and ready to publish for the game jam

Here is the URL for the Game Jam I am participating in

It's the [Brackey's 2025.2 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14)

The Game is hosted on itch now if you want to try it!
